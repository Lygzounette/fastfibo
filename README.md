# README

A very fast algorithm to calculate some values of the Fibonacci series.

Rust and Python implementation *(very simple and not ready for use, because of a lack of precision during computing)*.

TODO: 

- Parallel processing version (Rust)
- Add full precision result (as u128 in Rust)
- Extrapolation based on 4k+2 values to get any
- Mathematical details as .PDF
